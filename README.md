# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning  
**Task 04 – SkillCraft Technology Internship**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can accurately **identify and classify hand gestures** using image data. The aim is to enable intuitive **gesture-based human-computer interaction (HCI)** systems.

By leveraging image processing and classification techniques, the model helps pave the way for applications like:
- Sign language interpretation
- AR/VR gesture controls
- Smart automation and robotics

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a gesture recognition system that:
- Detects and classifies multiple hand gestures
- Works with image data (or video frames)
- Provides a foundation for real-time gesture-based interaction

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Computer Vision** – Extracting information from hand gesture images
- **Machine Learning** – Training a classifier to predict gestures
- **Image Preprocessing** – Grayscale conversion, resizing, thresholding, contour detection
- **Classification** – Using algorithms like SVM, KNN, or CNN for gesture recognition

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Load hand gesture images from dataset
- Convert to grayscale
- Resize images to a uniform shape (e.g., 64x64)
- Extract contours or flatten pixel data for feature extraction

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Use pixel values, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), or contour shapes

### 3. Model Training
- Train ML classifier (SVM, KNN, or a simple CNN)
- Split into training/testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualize using confusion matrix and sample predictions

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved accurate classification of various gestures using the chosen model
- Demonstrated robust performance on test data
- Model can be extended to real-time video input for live gesture recognition

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Real-time gesture recognition using webcam input
- Integration with gesture-based control systems or sign language translators
- Upgrade to deep learning models like CNNs for improved accuracy
